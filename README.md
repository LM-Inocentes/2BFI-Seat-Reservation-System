Developed a robust seat reservation desktop application tailored for efficient and user-friendly management of reservations in diverse settings such as theaters, conference rooms, and transportation services. Built using the .NET Framework, Visual Studio, and C#, the application features a responsive user interface allowing easy navigation and reservation management. Core functionalities include configurable seat settings, real-time seat selection and reservation, and the ability to save and load configurations for quick setup. Leveraging SQLite for data storage ensures reliable reservation management, while robust error handling and validation mechanisms ensure a smooth user experience. This project showcases proficiency in desktop application development, database management, and user interface design, demonstrating the ability to create functional, user-centric solutions using .NET technologies.
